A custom Archlinux live build for our office display

## Design Choices
I chose to build this with Archiso since that would allow quick duplication, as well as reduce the chance of hardware failure causing us to lose critical configuration.  In addition, the Archiso configuration files can be checked into version control, which provides many benefits.

I'll be filling this file out with more information as I build the platform.  For now, here's a skeleton of the info you can find here:
